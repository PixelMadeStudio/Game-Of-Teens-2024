            <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game that allows players to explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Survival Mode</h3>
                    <p>Players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health. Features a health bar and hunger mechanics. The goal is to survive against monsters and environmental hazards.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Creative Mode</h3>
                    <p>Players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly. No health or hunger bars, making it a peaceful and non-survival experience. Used for creating large builds or experimenting with game mechanics.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Adventure Mode</h3>
                    <p>Players can interact with objects (like levers and buttons) but can't destroy blocks. Often used for custom maps and adventures designed by other players.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Spectator Mode</h3>
                    <p>Players can fly through blocks and observe the game without directly interacting. Useful for watching other players or exploring worlds without interference.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Hardcore Mode</h3>
